** Define NPS color palates (builder will automatically display and select from changes made in config.js)

** Modify builder header set up:
 - rename link container to unit code (=name|type|location)
 - hide esri logo selector

** Header display in builder is confusing (hide ESRI icon and sharing link, show Unit Name/Type/Location)

* In mobile view, on the menu page, there is a linkcontainer, and logo container created dynamically in
mobile/header.js these elements are turn off (display:none) in nps.css.  It would be nice to replace these with
elements from the banner i.e the unit name/link, and the Arrowhead logo - This will require a bit more custom
programming

* Geocode locator (search button) is not styled the same as other buttons.

* Locate/Geocode buttons are bigger than the zoom buttons. (zoom buttons in viewer are smaller than in builder)

* NPS Styling for map controls is not applied in the Builder
